# model.Expense Tracker

A basic expense tracker to keep record of transactions for a budget

This is a web project using the Vue framework on the front end and Java Spring Boot Framework on the backend.

## Current Capabilities

Running the front end code displays a table with a few transactions already added. You can create, update, or delete entries from the table.

Here are my TODO items for the next push
1. Change the Date column to an actual date object.
2. Add data validation when creating or saving an expense.
3. Ask user to verify that they want to delete an entry.
